This folder contains a simple configuration file for a HAProxy Load Balancer which integrates with HashiCorp Consul to automatically discover service instances.

The config snippet allows for multiple instances of a service running on the same server to be served by the backend (useful for rolling/canary deploys). Without `resolve-opts allow-dup-ip`, haproxy skips on any repeat service node (duplicate ip â€“ even with a different port).
